# NLP_Feature_Engineering

I have performed Feature Engineering to extract new features from the URL, Title and Source. 
Further Text sentences and Title are TF-IDF encoded while remaining features are label encoded. 

These are then passed to RFC model whose parameters are tunes using Randomised Search and model is fit.
